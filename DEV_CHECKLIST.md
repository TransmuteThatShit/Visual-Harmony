# ðŸŽ¤ Full Lyric Sync + Vocal Processing Pipeline Dev Checklist

---

## 1. Transcription Setup

- [ ] Integrate OpenAI Whisper or Whisper.cpp for high-quality transcription
- [ ] Enable word-level timestamps extraction
- [ ] Support multiple audio formats (wav, mp3, m4a, etc.)
- [ ] Handle long files with chunking or streaming if needed

---

## 2. Whisper Output Handling

- [ ] Parse Whisper JSON output for segment and word-level data
- [ ] Convert Whisper output to a Moises-style JSON format for downstream use
- [ ] Handle missing or partial word timestamps gracefully
- [ ] (Optional) Extract or estimate confidence scores per word or segment

---

## 3. Segment Merging & Tagging

- [ ] Merge word-level segments into full lyric lines with start/end times
- [ ] Assign unique IDs and maintain original word arrays
- [ ] Implement tagging presets:
  - Chakra-based keyword detection & tagging
  - Harmony/emotion-based keyword tagging
  - Loop detection (repeated words or phrases)
  - Twin flame or sacred sexuality hints
- [ ] Support confidence-based filtering of segments
- [ ] Make tagging easily extensible (add new presets or keywords)

---

## 4. Multi-format Export

- [ ] Export plain text files with timestamps for quick editing
- [ ] Export CSV region files compatible with DAWs (Reaper regions)
- [ ] Export SRT subtitle files for video players and captioning
- [ ] Export VTT subtitle files for web and HTML5 players
- [ ] Export LRC files for karaoke-style synced lyrics (line level)
- [ ] Export ELRC files for extended karaoke with per-word timing
- [ ] Export JSON files preserving loop and tag metadata for custom apps

---

## 5. Integration & Automation

- [ ] Command-line interface to run from audio input through all steps
- [ ] Allow configuration via CLI args or config files (filter thresholds, presets, output paths)
- [ ] Support batch processing of multiple audio files/folders
- [ ] Log progress and errors clearly for debugging

---

## 6. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for:
  - Whisper JSON parsing
  - Segment merging logic
  - Tagging accuracy (keywords and loop detection)
  - Export format correctness (SRT, VTT, LRC, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - Overlapping segments
  - Missing timestamps
  - Empty or noisy input
- [ ] Validate outputs by loading them in Reaper, VLC, or karaoke apps

---

## 7. Advanced Features (Future/Optional)

- [ ] Extract vocal stems automatically and export sliced WAVs aligned with lyrics
- [ ] Generate MIDI harmony or backing track info based on lyrics/emotion tags
- [ ] Build a visual lyric sync player UI or web player with infinite zoom visualization
- [ ] Add confidence-based lyric correction or highlighting
- [ ] Integrate with your AI music video app for real-time caption + visual generation

---

## 8. Documentation & Usability

- [ ] Write clear README with setup instructions, usage examples
- [ ] Document CLI options and expected input/output formats
- [ ] Provide sample input audio + expected JSON + outputs for users to test
- [ ] Include troubleshooting tips and common error explanations

---

## 9. Deployment & Maintenance

- [ ] Package as a pip-installable Python module or standalone executable
- [ ] Automate updates for Whisper model and keyword presets
- [ ] Monitor user feedback and bug reports
- [ ] Plan regular code cleanup and feature enhancements
